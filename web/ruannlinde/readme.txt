There are two categories of SSL certificates that may be available to you, One would be a cPanel issued free SSL signed by Commodo/Sectigo and the other one is a paid SSL signed off by Geotrust. 

Now you may ask what is the difference between the two categories? 

1. Auto SSL (Free) 
===========
Valid for 3 months 
Issued by Commodo/Sectigo
Not recommended for e-commerce websites	
No company info in cert - Less trust	

2. Geotrust SSL (Paid)
===========
Valid for 1 Year
Issued by Geotrust
Highly recommended for e-commerce websites
Company information displayed

Please keep in mind that the paid SSL would require some extra information as well as a dedicated IP. Here are the options below: 

-> A dedicated IP costs R R720 per annum or R60 per month, Please let us know which you would prefer?

The PAID SSL certificate has a further two options, namely the following: 
-> Standard SSL: R 270 p/a (this would cover www.yourdomain.com and yourdomain.com for example)
-> Wildcard SSL: R 1820 p/a (this certificate would cover an unlimited amount of subdomains above the function of the standard SSL) 

If you are happy with the pricing and information, please confirm the following:

Please create an admin@ or administrator@ email address for the verification step and also for future SSL renewal reminders. 
Dedicated IP and SSL you choose :
Host to make cert for (for example www.afrihost.com or shop.afrihost.com): 
City: 
State/Province: 
Country (2 letter abbreviation, South Africa will be ZA): 
Company Name: 
Company Division: 

With this information, we can then order the SSL certificate. The entire process will take 2 hours to complete.
